      "question": "What are the steps of Process Data Use Case (CRISP - DM Model)?",
      "answer": "\n        Based on the context, the steps of the Process Data Use Case (CRISP - DM Model) include:\n\n1. Definition and objectives of the use case\n2. Evaluation of the current situation\n3. Plan of development\n4. Identification of data sources\n5. Collection and integration of data\n6. Data origination (create, collect, etc.)\n7. Data processing (digitize, check, validate, etc.)\n8. Data storage (describe metadata, secure, etc.)\n9. Data usage (distribute, analyze, transform, etc.)\n10. Data refreshment (update, track changes, etc.)\n\nThe use cases help identify concrete levers for creating value in the medium term. They are specific examples of the application of Data Management (DM). For instance, the contribution of Data Management in the implementation of a CRM system.
